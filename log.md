# #301DaysOfCode - Log

The daily log of my **#301DaysOfCode** challenge.

## Log

### Day 1: [24/08/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Today, I read about some of best practices of design- typography, spacing, and colors. This article was very beautiful written and I digest every bit of it. Then I read article about css-in-js. I have heard about it but don't used it so I thought I should read this article. Then I asked a question on stackoverflow about an sql error I'm getting while opening php project on my local enviornment. I got some good answers and get to know why this error is coming. But still I have to find a solution. Meanwhile, I developed a wordpress website with Tyler Moore, 2 pages.

**Thoughts:**
I have started 100 days of code but then left. Now I think that recording progress is very helpful, first it boost confidence after some time, second it would work like a database so when you forget something you read a month before you can comeback and get link to those project/article.

### Day 2: [25/08/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
Read an article on how to write better CSS. It was certainly very helpful. After all I was strugling to manage my css code. To be exact SCSS code and it cover all the topics from 7-in-1 pattern to BEM style. I have also managed to solve sql error in one of my paid projects. No wordpress today.

**Thoughts:**
It was Sunday today. So I don't do much of work. Only some articles and wandering here and there.

### Day 3: [26/08/2019]

**Today's Progress:**
It has been my passion to write my own blog post about what I'm going through in my journey to become a web developer. So when I saw a post by Chris Coyier about techinal writing, I started reading it. It is very helpful. Then I made some progress on my portfolio website. I wanted t have a gradient over my portfolio images. For this I search about gradient usage in css. I come across again Chris Coyier articles about gradients. I have'nt finished them yet.

**Thoughts:**
A little bit of work, but I think it is good.
